# Verified Queer Flag Emojis

This is a repository of art resources for the Verified Queer Flag Emojis you might have seen on the fediverse.

I've taken inspiration from the [VeriPride Maker](https://yuki.1337.lgbt/veripride/) generator, but found it lacking for some specific things tasks (like heavy customization), and the non-right-angle checkmark annoyed me when trying to get fill-ins to work, so I created a defacto template file from which I started basing every other flag-file of.

In these files, the "flowery" outline is taken from the SVG of twitter's website. The checkmark is mine, created by some long twiddling in an SVG editor.

I'm opening these files here to allow anyone to make their own flags as well :)

These files are released under [`CC NC-SA`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/nc-sa/1.0/).

This means;
- That you can remove attribution to me or this repo if you want (please do, I don't want the attention or popularity, I just want to empower people)
- That - if you make more flags deriving from these files - you should release it under the same license.
- That you cannot use this for commercial purposes.
  - First off because fuck corporations encroaching on queerness, but also because the whole point of these images are to allow people to stick a finger to any authority-beholden "verification" of queerness, so to speak. (You can read [my post](https://tech.lgbt/@ShadowJonathan/109473889530943426) on it, if you're curious.)
